  abstract       = {The complexity of machine learning models presents a substantial barrier to their adoption for many investors. The algorithms that generate machine learning predictions are sometimes regarded as  box, demanding interpretation and additional explanation. In this paper, we present a framework for demystifying the behavior of machine learning models and decomposing their predictions into linear, nonlinear, and interaction components. We also show how to decompose a model predictive efficacy into these same components. Together, this analysis forms a  fingerprint which we use to summarize its key characteristics and illustrate its similarities and differences compared to other models. We present a case study of this approach applying random forest, gradient boosting machine, and neural network models to the challenge of predicting monthly currency returns. We find that all three models reliably identify intuitive effects in the currency market, and that they also find new relationships attributable to nonlinearities and variable interactions. We argue that an understanding of these predictive components may help astute investors generate superior risk-adjusted returns.},

  abstract       = {In this article, the authors attempt to get a better understanding of the cross-section of alternative risk premiums using a multi-asset version of the downside risk capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In line with the empirical literature, they find that the cross-section of realized returns is much better explained when using the downside CAPM, rather than relying on the traditional CAPM. However, in contrast to the empirical literature, the authors cannot always recover the required signs in their cross-sectional regressions. In particular, they find that taking on downside risk is not always systematically rewarded. This might be due to the limited availability of time series that essentially overweight the exceptional events of 2008 or a direct result of creating backtests with attractive in-sample features that are impossible to repeat out-of-sample.},

  abstract       = {Machine learning is an increasingly important and controversial topic in quantitative finance. A lively debate persists as to whether machine learning techniques can be practical investment tools. Although machine learning algorithms can uncover subtle, contextual and non-linear relationships, overfitting poses a major challenge when trying to extract signals from noisy historical data. In this article, we describe some of the basic concepts surrounding machine leaning and provide a simple example of how investors can use machine learning techniques to forecast the cross-section of stock returns while limiting the risk of overfitting.},
